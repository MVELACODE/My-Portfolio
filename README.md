# My Portfolio

## Description

This is a simple, static portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS. It showcases information about me, my skills, educational background, coding interests, completed programs, and provides a contact form.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

## How to Use

1.  **Download the files:** Save the `index.html` and `style.css` files into the same directory.
2.  **Open in your browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

## Portfolio Structure

The portfolio is organized into the following sections:

* **Header:** Contains the main title "My Portfolio" and a navigation menu with links to different sections.
* **About:** An introduction about myself, my passion, and what drives me.
* **Skills:** A list of programming languages I am proficient in.

* **Footer:** Contains copyright information and links to social media profiles.

## Customization

You can easily customize this portfolio by editing the `index.html` file to change the content (text, links, lists) and the `style.css` file to modify the visual appearance (colors, fonts, layout).

* **Content:** Update the text within the `<p>` tags in each section to reflect your own information. Modify the lists in the "Skills," "Coding & Software Development," and "Coded Programs" sections. Replace `"your_cv.pdf"` with the actual path to your CV file. Update the `href` attributes for the social media links in the footer.
* **Styling:** Edit the `style.css` file to change the colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design of the website.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out! You can use the contact form on the website.

**Note:** The contact form on this static website will not actually send emails without additional backend technologies. It is a placeholder for visual representation.
